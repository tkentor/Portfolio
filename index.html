		<p>I am a 24 year old, recent D.C. transplant, born and raised in Austin, Texas. I graduated from Vanderbilt University in the spring of 2013 with a major in Human & Organizational Development and minors in Financial Economics and Corporate Strategy.</p>

		<p>After graduating, I moved back to my hometown to work as a Financial Analyst for Dell, Inc. While I certainly valued my time at Dell, I quickly found that finance was not the field for me. I became restless in the position that I had previously believed to be exactly what I was looking for, and I realized that finding work I loved required abandoning work I found comfortable.</p>

		<p>In the spring of 2014, a friend approached me about an opportunity to work for his import startup in Shanghai. My time in China was unforgettable and transformative, both professionally and personally. Unfortunately, challenges inherent to the import business prevented me from renewing my visa, and I moved back to the states this summer.</p>

		<p>My departure from China threw me into a situation of great uncertainty, but I believe that the uncertainty gave me the eventual clarity to pursue what will be my ideal professional setting. I took some time traveling, pausing, and reflecting on my strengths and my weaknesses, my interests, and my ideal work environment. Understanding that I thrive in situations which require creativity, determination, and logical reasoning, web development emerged as the near perfect opportunity.

		<p>Outside of work or school, I enjoy boxing, yoga, skiing, movies, traveling, politics, and cold beer. The background image is from a bungee jump in Dalian, China, taken on April 13, 2015.</p>
